  powerful tools.
- Datastore - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. 
- Kotlin - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- Coroutines - For asynchronous and more..
- Flow - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- Android Architecture Components - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
- ViewModel - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- Dependency Injection -
- Hilt-Dagger - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- Hilt-ViewModel - DI for injecting ViewModel.
- Retrofit - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- Glide v4 - An image loading library for Android
